# ü§ñ Local Command-Line Chatbot Using Hugging Face

Welcome to the Local Command-Line Chatbot project! This chatbot leverages the Hugging Face `facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill` text generation model to deliver coherent multi-turn conversations by maintaining a short-term memory of recent exchanges.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to build a fully functional, local chatbot interface using a Hugging Face text generation model. It runs entirely on your machine (GPU optional) and ensures smooth, interactive conversations via a command-line interface (CLI), managing context with a sliding window memory buffer.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Utilizes the Hugging Face `facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill` model with the `text2text-generation` pipeline  
- Maintains conversation history with a sliding window buffer tracking the last 5 turns  
- Robust CLI supporting continuous user input  
- Clean and graceful exit by typing `/exit`  
- Modular Python codebase consisting of:  
  - `model_loader.py`: Responsible for loading the model pipeline  
  - `chat_memory.py`: Manages sliding window conversational memory  
  - `interface.py`: Integrates CLI with model and memory modules
